CDMS (Core Data Mining Platform) was developed at Monash University
with the aim of providing a unified framework for disparate machine learning
model types, with a primary focus on MML (Minimum Message Length) for training.


The Primary Authors are, Josh Comley, Leight Fitzgibbon and Lloyd Allison.
Rodney O'Donnell is the current maintainer.

The primary publication to site for CDMS is:
@article{comley2003flexible,
  title={{Flexible decision trees in a general data-mining environment}},
  author={Comley, J. and Allison, L. and Fitzgibbon, L.},
  journal={Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning},
  pages={761--767},
  year={2003},
  publisher={Springer}
}



The main use for CDMS is now as a base for the CaMML Causal model learner.
